# Collateral-Backed-Token

This is a simple project demonstrating how to build a collateral-backed token using Solidity and the Ethereum blockchain. A collateral-backed token is a type of asset-backed token where the value of the token is linked to the value of an underlying asset (such as a stablecoin pegged to a fiat currency). The underlying asset is held as collateral, ensuring the token's value remains stable.
